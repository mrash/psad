Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP

4.058 Fri Nov 11 19:23:11 PST 2011
        up rev for documentation update
        update documentation in InetBase v0.06

4.057 Fri Nov 11 15:04:20 PST 2011
	Lite.pm v1.40
        add call to InetBase::fillIPv4 to all uses of gethostbyname

        break out the code in InetBase v0.05 that expands short IPv4 
        addresses into dotquad format to account for broken BSD 
        implementations of inet_aton and gethostbyname that do 
        not recognize the short format. EXPORT this as sub 'fillIPv4'

        in Util.pm v1.45, add 'fillIPv4' to calls to gethostbyname to 
        work around broken inet_aton and gethostbyname implementations
        in certain BSD implementations

4.056 Wed Nov  2 19:15:31 PDT 2011
        bump rev to incorporate
        improved inet_aton in InetBase v0.04 to overcome broken
        gethostbyname found in NetBSD and OpenBSD

4.055 Fri Oct 28 11:41:22 PDT 2011
	in Lite.pm v1.38
        patch for bug 71869, issues with Math::BigInt varients

4.054 Thu Oct 27 12:48:55 PDT 2011
        In Lite.pm v1.37, remove Calc.pm
        add detection of early Math::Bigint object structure
        fix bug 71869 - a failed test routine

4.053 Wed Oct 26 08:52:34 PDT 2011
	In Lite.pm v1.36
        fix bug #71925. A a sub-varient of #62521 that showed up only for
        short notation for IPv4. i.e. 127/n, 127.0/n, 127.0.0/n but
        not 127.0.0.0/n

4.052 Tue Oct 25 16:18:38 PDT 2011
        add test in Lite.pm v1.35 for api-version of Math::BigInt to 
	support versions earlier than 1.70, circa Dec 2003. 
        Thanks to Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> for spotting that bug.

4.051 Mon Oct 24 14:44:53 PDT 2011
	fix bug 71869
	in Lite.pm v1.34
        use Math::BigInt::Calc for creating BigInt values and fall
        back to NetAddr::IP::Calc if Math::BigInt is not present.

        remove reference to Config{osname} in InetBase.pm v0.03
        (Util 1.43)


4.050 Sat Oct 22 01:58:57 PDT 2011
        In Lite/Util/lib/NetAddr/IP/Lite/Util/InetBase.pm v0.02
        Socket6 prior to version 0.23 does not have AF_INET6 in the  
        EXPORT_OK array, modify InetBase.pm v0.2 to work around this.

	Add support for Math::BigInt to NetAddr::IP::Lite v1.33

4.049 Sat Oct 15 22:15:10 PDT 2011
	Updates to Lite.pm, Util.pm, new module InetBase.pm

	In Lite v1.32
        bug68723, add capability to parse input of the form
        ->new6(12345,1). This should have been there but was
        missing. Thanks to Andrei Benea for spotting this.
        
        In Util v1.41
        add inet_pton, inet_ntop, AF_INET, AF_INET6

        modify inet_n2dx and inet_n2ad to
        recognize the new 128 bit IPv4 format
        ::FFFF:FFFF:0:0

        replace isIPv4 with a pure perl version for portablity

        split the following into NetAddr::IP::InetBase v0.01
	to provide better long term support for IPv6
        inet_aton
        inet_ntoa
        ipv6_aton
        ipv6_n2x
        ipv6_n2d
        inet_any2n
        inet_n2dx
        inet_n2ad
        inet_ntop
        inet_pton
        packzeros
        isIPv4
        isNewIPv4
        isAnyIPv4
        AF_INET
        AF_INET6

4.048 Sat Oct  8 01:33:44 PDT 2011
	remove debug print statement from Util v1.40

	doc update only in Lite.pm v1.30

4.046 Thu Oct  6 20:20:33 PDT 2011		DEPRECATED
	corrected missing reference to inet_4map6 in Util v1.38

	updated NetAddr::IP::Util 1.37
        addid isAnyIPv4, isNewIPv4, inet_4map6
        revised naip_gethostbyname
        to conform to Perl's gethostbyname output

4.044 Wed May 18 14:47:34 PDT 2011
	added missing support for ->compactref(\@list) which is described
	in the documentation but not implemented.

	Thanks to Rusty Bourland codebard@gmail.com for spotting this
	and providing both a patch and test code

4.043 Wed Apr  6 11:31:19 PDT 2011
	Update documentation on the use of "adding constants 
	to an IP address".

4.042 Tue Mar 22 15:26:02 PDT 2011
	Update Lite.pm v1.27 to encompass treatment of /31 and /127 
	point-to-point networks as described in RFC 3021

	NOTE: for /31's and /127's
	this changes the behavior of the following methods:
		first   returns the "network" address
		last    returns the "broadcast" address
		nth     index 0 returns "network" addr instead of undef
		nth     index 1 returns "broadcast" addr instead of undef
		num     returns 2 instead of 0 (zero)

	"old_nth" behavior is unchanged

	Thanks to Todd Caine todd.caine@gmail.com for pointing this out.

4.041 Tue Mar  8 15:18:16 PST 2011

4.038 Fri Dec 17 17:47:47 PST 2010
	Modify subs "new" and "new6" in Lite.pm to accomodate
	Cisco mask syntax that uses space instead of "/" for a separator

4.037 Fri Nov 19 10:48:01 PST 2010
	add :upper and :lower to Lite.pm v1.23
	add comments about rfc5952 requirement for lowercase ipV6 notation

4.036 Tue Nov 16 16:28:37 PST 2010
	In Util.pm v1.35, naip_gethostbyname modified to return undef 
	instead of 0 (zero) on failure

	thanks to Terry Cassidy enaudishaylee@tc17.com for the bug report

	In Util.pm v1.35, move sub's ipv6_n2d and ipv6_n2x to non-autosplit

	variables

	thanks to Nicholas Bamber <nicholas@periapt.co.uk>
	Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=517361

	In Lite.pm v1.22, update new6 to properly classify short ipv4 notation
	i.e. 127/8 with test for ":" rather than match for \d.\d.\d.\d
	
	thanks to Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org for 
	spotting that bug.

	In Lite.pm v1.22, update t/v4-new.t for deprecated array syntax in 
	perl 5.13

	is:     (qw(...stuff...))

	thanks to Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> for reporting this

4.035 Thu Oct 28 14:26:19 PDT 2010
	fix bug in Lite v1.21 where new6 improperly assigns the mask value 
	for and ipv4 address in 32 bit space instead of 128 bit space

	Thanks to Mark Martinec and Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org
	for spotting and replicating that bug

	added new_cis and new_cis6 to Lite.pm v1.21 to accomodate
	Cisco syntax that has IP and MASK seperated by a space.

	see perl bug [ 23429]. Unfortunately, perl-5.8.4 is
	the distribution of choice for many solaris boxes  

4.019  Sat Nov 29 15:15:30 PST 2008
	in Lite/Util, add pure perl testing to XS build

	objects into multiple pieces with differing CIDR masks.
	Returned object list can be split from bottom to top
	or from top to bottom depending on which method is called

		split, rsplit, splitref, rsplitref

	Thanks to kashmish <kashmish@gmail.com> for the idea on
	improving functionality of 'split'.

	Thanks to Rob Riepel <riepel@networking.Stanford.EDU>

	correct documentation error
	add threads reporting (empty string)

  in Util v1.25
	add threads reporting that returns a comma separated
	string of build headers.

	serialization. Must be invoked by "--with-threads"

  in Lite v1.12
	corrected missing Zeros subroutine
	Zeros and Zero both will work

  in Lite v1.12
	added minus (-) overloading to allow the subtraction
	of two NetAddr::IP objects to get the difference between
	the object->{addr}'s as a numeric value
	Thanks to Rob Riepel <riepel@networking.Stanford.EDU>
	for the initial code and inspiration for this enhancement

4.016  Wed Nov  5 18:13:20 PST 2008

	in Lite.pm v1.11, add test for characters not allowed by
	rfc952 before the call to gethostbyname in sub new() for those
	people that insist on using deprecated functionality :aton
	and OS's that fail to notice calls to gethostbyname with
	binary arguments.

4.013  Wed Oct 22 15:04:49 PDT 2008
	In Lite.pm v1.10, add new no octal method for
	improperly formatted ipV4 addresses

	thanks to Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
	for spotting this and submitting a patch.

	In Util.pm v1.22, force -noxs mode for Win32

	In Util.pm v1.22, use autoconf to configure 'C' build

4.012  Thu Oct 16 19:35:33 PDT 2008
	clear build bug for Win32 in Util.pm v 1.21

4.011  released Oct 6 13:10

4.010  Sat Sep 27 17:00:28 PDT 2008
    in NetAddr::IP::Util v0.19
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1 would fail to return undef

NOTE: 	Versions 4.008 and 4.009 had limited release to tester only
	and were not uploaded to CPAN. All of the v4.008, 4.009
	changes are incorporated in v4.010

4.009  Tue Sep  2 19:09:57 PDT 2008
	In NetAddr::IP::Lite v1.07,
	in the off chance that NetAddr::IP::Lite objects are created
	and the caller later loads NetAddr::IP and expects to use
	those objects, let the AUTOLOAD routine find and redirect
	NetAddr::IP::Lite method and subroutine calls to NetAddr::IP.

	updated Lite/t/v4-wnew.t so that non-existent
	domains are "really" not there

4.008  Sat Jun  7 14:01:55 PDT 2008
	inherit method "new_from_aton" from NetAddr::IP::Lite
	add related documentation

      Inherited methods from Lite.pm updated as follows:

	comparisons of the form <, >, <=, >=
		10.0.0.0/24 {operator} 10.0.0.0/16
	return now return the comparison of the cidr value
	when the address portion is equal.
NOTE:	this comparison returns the comparison of the NUMERIC
	value of the CIDR. This produces the counter intuitive result
	that /24 > /16. There is logic to this, really! For proper
	operation of commands like "Compact" and "Coalesce", lists of
	netaddr objects must sort in ascending order. However, this
	conflicts with the requirement for larger netblocks to sort
	FIRST so as to include smaller ones. This logic extends to
	any requirement for a sort of netaddr objects. It should be
	further noted that the mixing of netaddr objects with varying
	IP addresses and CIDR allocations can lead to unexpected
	results since the comparisons done first on the IP portion
	and then on the CIDR portion. The documentation has been
	updated appropriately.
	Thanks to Peter DeVries for spotting this discrepancy
