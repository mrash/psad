This README applies to the patch files contained within the "patches"
directory in the psad (http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad) sources.

The patches in this directory are organized by kernel version or iptables
version, so "linux-2.4.27_conntrack.patch" applies to the linux-2.4.27
kernel, and "iptables-1.3.8_LOG_prefix_space.patch" applies to iptables-1.3.8.

The "iptables-1.3.8_LOG_prefix_space.patch" adds a trailing space to any
iptables log prefix that does not already include a space. This means that an
iptables log prefix cannot break the separator tokens (specifically the IN=
token) in an iptables log message.  More information about this can be found
here:

http://www.cipherdyne.org/

Many of the patches in this directory apply to the conntrack module.
Specifically, each patch extends the close wait timeout for TCP connections
from 60 seconds to 2 minutes.  If you are seeing iptables log messages for TCP
ACK packets associated with legitimate TCP connections (i.e. packets are not
being correctly identified as such by the conntrack module), you may want to
apply the appropriate conntrack patch. See the BUGS section of the psad man
page for more information.
