psad-2.1.6 (04//2009):
    - (Franck Joncourt) Added --Override-config feature so that alternate
      configuration files can be specified on the command line to override
      configuration variables in the standard /etc/psad/psad.conf file.
    - (Franck Joncourt) Submitted patches to fix stderr redirection for the
      usage of the mail binary, and to close stdout, stdin, and stderr when
      running psad as a daemon.

psad-2.1.5 (02/20/2009):
    - (Miroslav Grepl) Contributed policy files to make psad compatible with
      SELinux.  The files are located in a new "selinux" directory in the
      psad sources.
    - Bug fix for local server ports not reported correctly under netstat
      parsing (Franck Joncourt).
    - (Steve B) Submitted patch to fix a bug in the start() function in the
      Gentoo init script which caused psad to not be started and the error
      "* ERROR: psad failed to start" to be generated.
    - Bug fix when ENABLE_SYSLOG_FILE is enabled to run a preliminary regex
      match on each syslog message because kmsgsd is not running and therefore
      has not gone through the kmsgsd tests for a properly structured iptables
      message.
    - Updated IPTables::Parse to 0.7.
    - Updated IPTables::ChainMgr to 0.9.

psad-2.1.4 (08/21/2008):
    - Restructured perl module paths to make it easy to introduce a "nodeps"
      distribution of psad that does not contain any perl modules.  This
      allows better integration with systems that already have all necessary
      modules installed (including the IPTables::ChainMgr and IPTables::Parse
      modules).  The main driver for this work is to make all cipherdyne.org
      projects easily integrated with distributions based on Debian, and
      Franck Joncourt has been instrumental in making this process a reality.
      All perl modules are now placed within the "deps" directory, and the
      install.pl script checks to see if this directory exists - a separate
      psad-<ver>-nodeps tarball will be distributed without this directory.
      The Debian package for psad can then reference the -nodeps tarball, and
      a new "psad-nodeps.spec" file has been added to build an RPM from the
      psad sources that does not install any perl modules.
    - Updated to use the normal system whois client if the /usr/bin/whois_psad
      path does not exist, and moved the whois/ directory into the deps/
      directory.  This removes /usr/bin/whois_psad as a strict dependency.
    - Bugfix to honor the IPT_SYSLOG_FILE variable in --Analyze-msgs mode.
    - Switched from the deprecated bleeding-all.rules file to the new
      emerging-all.rules available from Matt Jonkman at Emerging Threats
      (http://www.emergingthreats.net).

psad-2.1.3 (06/07/2008):
    - Updated to enable IPT_SYSLOG_FILE by default.  This is a relatively
      important change since it changes the method of acquiring iptables log
      data from reading it out of named pipe from syslog to just parsing the
      /var/log/messages file.  This implies that kmsgsd does not have to run,
      and that it is much easier to ensure that psad actually receives
      iptables log messages.  The most complex and error prone aspect of psad
      in the past has been the reconfiguration of the various syslog daemons
      out there (which have very different configuration syntax and features)
      to write kern.info messages to the /var/lib/psad/psadfifo named pipe.
    - Updated to version 4.7.26 of the whois client from Marco d'Itri.  This
      allows whois records for some addresses (such as 116.125.35.98, which
      which was scanning a system running psad but could not be identified
      under the older whois client) to be properly queried.
    - Updated to Bit::Vector 6.4 from 6.3.
    - Updated to Date::Calc 5.4 from 5.3.
    - Updated to Storable 2.18 from 2.16.

psad-2.1.2 (04/03/2008):
    - Bugfix to not include kernel timestamps in iptables log prefixes that
      contain spaces like "[   65.026008] DROP" (bug reported by Erik Heidt).
    - Bugfix to skip non-resolved IP addresses (bug reported by Albert Whale)
    - Better p0f output in --debug mode to display when a passive OS
      fingerprint cannot be calculated based on iptables log messages that
      include tcp options (i.e., with --log-tcp-options when building a LOG
      rule on the iptables command line).

psad-2.1.1 (01/25/2008):
    - Added a new feature whereby psad can acquire iptables log data just by
      parsing an existing file (/var/log/messages by default) that is written
      to by syslog.  By default, psad acquires iptables log data from the
      /var/log/psad/fwdata file which is written to by kmsgsd, but on some
      systems, having syslog communicate log data to kmsgsd can be problematic
      since syslog configs and external factors such as Apparmor and SELinux
      can play a role here.  This new feature is controled by two new
      configuration variables "ENABLE_SYSLOG_FILE" (to enable/disable the
      feature) and "IPT_SYSLOG_FILE" to specifiy the path to the file to
      parse.
    - Better installation support for various Linux distributions including
      Fedora 8 and Ubuntu.  The current runlevel is now acquired via the
      "runlevel" command instead of attempting to read /etc/inittab (which
      does not even exist on Ubuntu 7.10), and there are new command line
      arguments --init-dir, --init-name, and --runlevel to allow the init
      directory, init script name, and the runlevel to be manually specified
      on the install.pl command line.
    - Updated psad to automatically handle situations where the either the
      /var/log/psad/fwdata file or the /var/log/messages file (whichever
      syslog is writing iptables log messages to) gets rotated.  The
      filehandle is closed and reopened if the file shrinks or if the inode
      changes.  This strategy is borrowed from how the fwknop project deals
      with the filesystem packet capture file.
    - Minor bugfix to generate syslog message when restarting a psad process.
    - Updated install.pl to set the LC_ALL environmental variable to "C"
      This should address some issues with installing psad on non-English
      locale systems.
    - Updated install.pl to be compatible with the rsyslog daemon, which is
      commonly installed on Fedora 8 systems.

psad-2.1 (10/19/2007):
    - Changed EMAIL_LIMIT model to apply to scanning source addresses only
      instead of also factoring in the destination address. The original
      src/dst email limit behavior can be restored by setting a new variable
      "ENABLE_EMAIL_LIMIT_PER_DST" to "Y".
    - Added the patches/iptables-1.3.8_LOG_prefix_space.patch file which can
      be applied to the iptables-1.3.8 code to enforce a trailing space
      character before any log prefix when a LOG rule is added. This ensures
      that the user cannot break the iptables syslog format just by forgetting
      to include a space at the end of a logging prefix.
    - Bugfix to ensure that parsing TCP options does not descend into an
      infinite loop in some some circumstances with obscure or maliciously
      constructed options.  Also added syslog reporting for broken options
      lengths of zero or one byte (the minimum option length is two bytes to
      accomodate the TLV encoding).
    - Bugfix to enforce the usage of --CSV-fields in --gnuplot mode.
    - Implemented --get-next-rule-id so that it is easy to assign a new rule
      ID to a new signature in the /etc/psad/signatures file.
    - Updated to just call die() if GetOpt fails; this allows erroneous usage
      of the command line to display informative error messages more clearly.

psad-2.0.8 (07/27/2007):
    - Added --gnuplot mode so that psad can output data that is suitable for
      plotting with gnuplot. All output produced in this mode is integer data
      with the exception of date stamps that are derived from iptables syslog
      messages.
    - Added the ability to negate match conditions on fields specified with
      the --CSV-fields argument by prepending the string "not" (which plays
      more nicely with shells like bash than a character like "!"). For
      example, to graph all packet data in --gnuplot or --CSV modes that
      originates from the 11.11.0.0/16 subnet and is not destined for port
      80, the following argument does the trick:

            --CSV-fields "src:11.11.0.0/16 dp:not80"

    - In --gnuplot mode, added the ability to generate the count for a CSV
      field instead of the field itself. Supported modes are an absolute
      count (<field>:count) , and a unique count (<field>:uniqcount). This
      is useful to plot graphs of source IP vs. the number unique ports for
      example.  Also added the ability to count iptables log fields over
      various time scales (minutes, hours, and days) with the following
      switches: <field>:countday, <field>:counthour, <field>:countmin.
    - In --gnuplot mode, added the ability to specify the view coordinates
      for 3D graph viewing with --gnuplot-view.
    - Added the Storable-2.16 module along with the --use-store-file argument
      so that in --gnuplot mode the Gnuplot data can be stored on disk and
      retrieve quickly.  This eliminates a large performance bottleneck when
      Gnuplot configuration directives are tweaked while the same graph is
      generated multiple times.
    - Added --gnuplot-template so that a template file can be used for all
      Gnuplot directives (usually psad creates the .gnu file based on the
      --gnuplot command line arguments).
    - Added --gnuplot-grayscale to generate graphs without the default red
      color for graph points.
    - Bugfix for regular expressions not being imported correctly from within
      the --CSV-fields argument.
    - Added --analysis-fields so the iptables log messages that are parsed in
      -A mode can be restricted to those that meet certain criteria. For
      example, to restrict the analyze mode to process packets with a source
      address of 192.168.10.1, use this command:

            psad -A --analysis-fields "src:192.168.10.1"

    - Added --plot-separator to allow the format of plot data (either in
      --gnuplot or --CSV modes) to be influenced by the user.
    - Added the ability to configure the syslog facility and priority via the
      psad.conf file (see the SYSLOG_FACILITY and SYSLOG_PRIORITY variables).
    - Updated psad.spec file to respect the %_initrddir RPM macro.

psad-2.0.7 (05/28/2007):
    - Bugfix to define a custom 'source' definition for syslog-ng daemons -
      this fixes a problem on SuSE systems where the existing syslog-ng
      reconfig caused the daemon to not start.
    - Bugfix to allow specific signatures to be ignored by setting SID values
      of zero in /etc/psad/snort_rule_dl.
    - Added -X command line argument to allow the user to delete any psad
      chains (in auto-response mode).  This is a synonym for the iptables -X
      command line argument.

psad-2.0.6 (03/24/2007):
    - Better integration with fwsnort; psad signature match syslog messages
      and email alerts now include the fwsnort rule number (for fwsnort
      version 0.9.0 and greater) and chain information.
    - Added the Snort bleeding-all.rules signature file from the Bleeding
      Snort project (see http://www.bleedingsnort.com).
    - Bugfix to allow interfaces that have IP aliases.
    - Added uname, ifconfig, and syslog process information to --Dump-conf
      output (this can help diagnose various runtime issues).
    - Changed the --Lib-dir command line argument to --lib-dir, and added
      --List (similar to iptables) to list the psad auto-blocking chain rules.
    - Added psad.SlackBuild script contributed by pyllyukko for building psad
      on Slackware systems.  It uses the Cipherdyne cd_rpmbuilder script to
      first build and RPM, and then uses it to build a Slackware package.

psad-2.0.5 (03/01/2007):
    - Consolidated all configuration variables into the /etc/psad/psad.conf
      file. The kmsgsd.conf, psadwatchd.conf, alert.conf, and fw_search.conf
      files were all removed since the daemons just reference the psad.conf
      now.  Updated install.pl to archive and remove these files if they
      exist from a previous psad installation.
    - Bugfix to account for iptables -nL output where the protocol may be
      reported as "0" instead of "all".
    - Added a function safe_malloc() for kmsgsd.c and psadwatchd.c to ensure
      that a single API is used to perform a NULL check on heap-allocated
      memory.
    - Bugfix to ensure that the psad_ip_len signature matching keyword is
      checked withing match_snort_ip_keywords() so that it applies to all
      protocol packets.  This fixes a bug that would cause the "PSAD-CUSTOM
      Nachi worm reconnaisannce" signature to fire on normal ICMP packet log
      messages.
    - Added version and Subversion file revision numbers to die and warn
      messages that are written to /var/log/psad/errs/.  This helps when
      trying to track these messages down to a specific file revisions when
      psad is being upgraded on the local system.
    - Added version and Subversion file revision numbers to --Dump-conf
      output.
    - Minor update to allow --fw-dump to be used on the command line without
      also having to use the -D argument.
    - Updated the default_log() function in the IPTables::Parse module to
      handle iptables policies that were dumped with -v, such as when
      --Dump-conf is used.

psad-2.0.4 (01/27/2007):
    - Added Snort rule matches to syslog alerts.  Multiple matches can be
      controlled with new configuration variables in psad.conf:
      ENABLE_SIG_MSG_SYSLOG, SIG_MSG_SYSLOG_THRESHOLD, and
      SIG_SID_SYSLOG_THRESHOLD.
    - Bugfix to include scanned UDP port ranges in syslog alerts.
    - Bugfix to parse SEQ and ACK iptables log message fields (requires
      --log-tcp-sequence on the iptables command line).  This allows the ipEye
      signature to work.
    - Added --debug-sid to allow a specific Snort rule to be debugged while
      psad runs it through its detection engine.  A consequence of this is
      that the -d command line argument must be spelled out, i.e. "psad
      --debug".
    - Bugfix to allow logging prefixes to omit trailing spaces.  This is a bug
      in the iptables logging format to allow this in the first place, but
      before this gets fixed psad needs to compensate.
    - Bugfix for syslog-ng init script path in install.pl.
    - Bugfix to include a "source" definition for /proc/kmsg if not already
      defined for syslog-ng daemons.
    - Minor memory handling bugfixes discovered by valgrind the excellent
      Valgrind project: http://www.valgrind.org

psad-2.0.3 (12/31/2006):
    - Removed Psad.pm perl module and kmsgsd.pl and psadwatchd.pl scripts.
      This is a major change that allows psad to be more flexible and
      completely derive its config from the psad.conf file and from the
      command line.  In the previous scheme, psad imported its config with a
      function within Psad.pm, and this required that psad imported the Psad
      perl module before reading its config. A consequence was that the
      PSAD_LIBS_DIR var could not be specified usefully within the config
      file.
    - Added the ability to recursively resolve embedded variables from *.conf
      files (with a limit of 20 resolution attempts).
    - Added IGNORE_KERNEL_TIMESTAMP so that Linux distros that add a timestamp
      to all kernel messages (Ubuntu for example) can be ignored.
    - Consolidated code to import data out of /var/log/psad/<ip> directories
      with code to display status and analysis output (-S and -A).
      Essentially the %scan hash is built by the filesystem data import
      routine and the remainder of the code references this single data
      structure.

psad-2.0.2 (12/23/2006):
    - Added the ability to download the latest signatures from cipherdyne.org
      in install.pl.
    - Added the cd_rpmbuilder script to make it easy to build RPM's out of
      CipherDyne projects by automatically downloading the project .tar.gz and
      .spec files from http://www.cipherdyne.org/.
    - Added print statements for @INC array in debug mode so that the user can
      see the additional /usr/lib/psad/* directories added by
      import_psad_perl_modules().
    - Changed Unix::Syslog import strategy from "use" to "require" since the
      path is not known until import_psad_perl_modules() gets a chance to
      run (psad ran fine without this, but it is more consistent this way).
    - Bugfix for not properly including elements of the
      @connected_subnets_cidr array.
    - IP subnet bugfix to make sure to get the entire subnet in signature
      import routine if it is not in CIDR format
    - Bugfix to not print an IP addresses in the "top attackers" section that
      do not have at least one packet or signature match (for any reason).
    - Bugfix to not print more than TOP_IP_LOG_THRESHOLD IP addresses in thet
      top attackers section.
    - Updated install.pl to reference configuration paths directly from
      psad.conf instead of defining them separately.  This should fix Debian
      bug #403566.
    - Added -c argument to install.pl so that the path to a psad.conf file
      can be altered from the command line.
    - Bugfix to not import any IP from the top_attackers file from a previous
      psad run that does not have a /var/log/psad/<ip> directory.
    - Added MIN_DANGER_LEVEL to allow all alerts and /var/log/psad/<ip>
      tracking to be disabled unless an attacker reaches at least this
      danger level.
    - Added text in install.pl to mention ifconfig parsing for HOME_NET
      derivation.

psad-2.0.1 (12/12/2006):
    - Added Nachi worm reconnaisannce icmp signature
    - Added the psad_ip_len signature keyword to allow the length field in the
      IP header to be explicitly tested.
    - Bugfix for inappropriately removing some directories in @INC when
      splicing in psad perl module paths.
    - Switched nf2csv installation path in install.pl to /usr/bin/.

psad-2.0 (12/10/2006):
    - Completely refactored the Snort rule matching support in psad.  Added
      many header field tests with full range matching support.  These tests
      include the following keywords from Snort: ttl, id, seq, ack, window,
      icmp_id, icmp_seq, itype, icode, ip_proto, ipopts, and sameip.
    - Refactored all signatures in /etc/psad/signatures to conform to new
      signature matching support in this release.  There are now about 190
      signatures that psad can run directly against Netfilter logging
      messages (i.e. without the help of fwsnort).
    - Added the ability to download the latest signatures file from
      http://www.cipherdyne.org/psad/signatures with the --sig-update command
      line argument to psad.
    - Added "MISC Windows popup spam" signature.  This allows psad to detect
      when attempts are made to send spam via the Windows Messenger service.
    - Completely reworked --Status and --Analyze output, signature matches
      are included now, along with a listing of top sig matches, top scanned
      ports, and top attackers.  Also, scan data is not written to
      /var/log/psad/ipt_analysis/ before display analysis output in -A mode;
      analysis results are displayed much faster this way.
    - Added ipEye, Subversion, Kuang2, Microsoft SQL, Radmin, and Ghostsurf
      signatures.
    - Added 'data in TCP SYN packet' signature.
    - Added --CSV mode so that psad can be used to generate comma-separated
      value output suitable for the AfterGlow project (see
      http://afterglow.sourceforge.net/index.html) for graphical
      representations of Netfilter logs and associated scan data.  Also added
      nf2csv so that normal users can take advantage of this feature.
    - Added emulation of the Snort "dsize" test through the use of the IP
      length field for TCP/ICMP signatures, and the UDP length field for UDP
      signatures.  For SYN packets, TCP options are included so psad
      automatically adds 44 bytes (the maximum length for TCP options) so the
      dsize test corresponds to the estimated payload length.
    - Added the psad_id, psad_dsize, and psad_derived_sids fields for the new
      Snort rule support.
    - Added the ability to decode IP options, which are included within Snort
      rules as the "ipopts" keyword.  This functionality requires that the
      --log-ip-options command line argument is given to iptables when
      building a rule that uses the LOG target.
    - Added Snort rules (sids 475, 500, 501, and 502) that detect IP options
      usage such as source routing and the traceroute IP option with the new
      IP options decoder.
    - Enhanced psad email alert output to include sid values that have been
      derived from existing Snort rules.
    - Added the ability to expand embedded variables within the psad
      configuration files.  For example, the path to the FW_DATA_FILE is
      defined in psad.conf as "$PSAD_DIR/fwdata", which resolves to
      /var/log/psad/fwdata when the PSAD_DIR variable is expanded.  This
      feature allows a consistent set of file paths to easily be defined
      instead of using the full path for each file path.
    - Better validation of IPT_AUTO_CHAIN{n} variables so that the from_chain
      cannot be identical to the to_chain.
    - Added dump_config() to psadwatchd.c and kmsgsd.c when compiled with
      debugging support.
    - Added ENABLE_INTF_LOCAL_NETS to have psad automatically treat all IP
      addresses that are part of the local system as belonging to the HOME_NET
      for signature matching.
    - Added ENABLE_SNORT_SIG_STRICT to have psad exit if there are any
      problems found with Snort rules in the /etc/psad/signatures file.  If
      this feature is disabled (this is the default), then psad generates
      syslog warnings for improperly formatted signatures).
    - Update to print the number of IP addresses at each danger level in -A
      analysis mode.  This is useful to get a sense for how long the disk IO
      might take to write out all of the /var/log/psad/ipt_analysis/<IP>
      directories.
    - Added code to restart kmsgsd at psad start up if a previous kmsgsd
      process is still running and TRUNCATE_FWDATA is set to 'Y' (this is the
      default).  This probably isn't strictly necessary because kmsgsd is
      capable of writing to the fwdata file even if another process truncates
      it.
    - Added code to recreate the AUTO_IPT_SOCK (/var/run/psad/auto_ipt.sock)
      file if some other process happens to delete it out of /var/run/psad/
    - Bugfix to allow backwards compatibility with old NOT_USED value
      for the HOME_NET variable.
    - Bugfix to cleanup any lost blocking rules from the running psad
      timeouts (a separate process might have deleted rules from the psad
      chains).
    - Bugfix to allow Netfilter log messages to include the PHYSDEV (i.e.
      PHYSIN and PHYSOUT) interfaces.
    - Updated to read architecture-dependent perl module installation
      directory out of /usr/lib/psad (e.g. "/usr/lib/psad/x86_64-linux")
      before importing psad perl modules such as IPTables::Parse, etc. These
      modules are now imported via "require" after the appropriate
      directories have been added to @INC. This allows the RPM files to be
      built on one system that builds @INC differently than the system where
      psad is actually installed since psad can now compensate for this.
    - Added new code to populate the <dst>_signature file in each of the
      /var/log/psad/<ip> directories with verbose information including the
      signature time, sid, protocol, dst port, and packet count.
    - Changed --interval to --Interval, and added --interface to allow
      psad's detection to be limited to a specific IN interface for the INPUT
      and FORWARD chains (or OUT interface for the OUTPUT chain).
    - Replaced --status-brief with --status-summary, but changed it so that
      only the detailed IP status information is omitted.
    - Removed unnecessary --status-sort-dl option.
    - Added STATUS_OUTPUT_FILE so the --Status and --Analyze output is
      captured instead of just being lost if the output was not piped to
      'less' or another similar program.
    - Added --restrict-ip so that psad will restrict its attack detection
      operations to a specific IP or network.
    - Updated psadwatchd.c to parse EMAIL_ADDRESSES out of
      /etc/psad/psad.conf to avoid duplication of variables.
    - Bugfix to clear old @ipt_config array after receiving a HUP signal.
      This bug broke the auto-blocking mode.
    - Bugfix for syslog-ng config so that any custom source for /proc/kmsg is
      used for the psadfifo path.

psad-1.4.8 (10/15/2006):
    - Added the ability to get the auto-blocking status for a specific IP
      address in --status-ip mode.
    - Bugfix to use the IPT_OUTPUT_FILE and IPT_ERROR_FILE configuration
      variables.
    - Bugfix to restore "start" functionality in Gentoo init script.
    - Added the ability to selectively disable psad auto-blocking emails.
    - Added more rigorous IP matching regex from Sebastien J. (contributed
      originally for fwknop).

psad-1.4.7 (09/10/2006):
    - Completely re-worked IPTables::ChainMgr to support the return of
      iptables error messages that are collected via stderr.  This is critical
      to fixing a bug where psad would sometimes die on an iptables command
      but no information would be returned to the user.
    - Added the ability to specify the position for both the jump rule into
      the psad chains as well as the position for new rules within the psad
      chains via the -I argument to iptables.  This fixes a bug where the user
      was given the impression that the IPTABLES_AUTO_RULENUM would accomplish
      this.
    - Populated the _debug option in the IPTables::ChainMgr module, and also
      added a _verbose option so that the specific iptables commands can
      actually be seen as IPTables::ChainMgr functions are called.
    - Added code to install.pl to ask the user if a manual restart of syslog
      is ok upon an unsuccessful test of the syslog reconfiguration.  This
      fixes a bug where some syslog daemons might not re-import their
      configurations after receiving a HUP signal.
    - Bugfix for incorrect config variable name that gated Netfilter
      prerequisite checks.
    - Added code to install.pl to update command paths in psad.conf and
      psadwatchd.conf if any of the paths are broken (i.e. the local system
      does not conform to the default paths).  By default this only happens if
      the user does not want old configs to be merged, but to override this
      use the new --path-update command line argument to install.pl.
    - Added the --Skip-mod-install command line argument to install.pl to
      allow all perl module installs to be skipped.
    - Added the --force-mod-regex command line argument to install.pl to allow
      a regex match on perl module names to force matching modules to be
      installed.
    - Added the logrotate.psad file (contributed by Albert Whale).

psad-1.4.6 (06/13/2006):
    - Added ENABLE_AUTO_IDS_REGEX and AUTO_BLOCK_REGEX to allow filtering on
      logging prefixes.
    - Added code to save DShield email to a file.
    - Added IPTABLES_PREREQ_CHECK to allow the administrator to control the
      frequency of Netfilter checks (for auto-block compatibility).
    - Added IGNORE_LOG_PREFIXES to allow certain log prefixes to be completely
      ignored by psad.
    - Added classification.config file from Snort-2.3.3 so that psad can
      assign danger levels based upon Snort rule class type.  This is useful
      when also running fwsnort.
    - Added snort_rule_dl to allow specific psad to assign specific danger
      level values to particular signatures.  This is useful if you want to
      do define certain Snort rules as being particularly evil (or not).
      Running fwsnort is also necessary to take advantage of this feature.
    - Added reference.config so that psad can include reference information in
      email alerts that are derived from attacks detected by fwsnort.
    - Updated to Snort-2.3.3 signatures.
    - Updated to whois-4.7.13.

psad-1.4.5 (01/13/2006):
    - Bugfix in IPTables::Parse to allow the limit target to apply to
      logging rules.
    - Made calls to chain creation and jump rule functions for only every
      100 block calls in auto-IDS mode.
    - Bugfix to make sure /var/run/psad directory exists at startup since
      this directory is removed by some Linux distributions at boot time.
    - Bugfix for zero masks in auto_dl; this allows a network of "0.0.0.0/0"
      to be specified.
    - Added ENABLE_FW_LOGGING_CHECK so that the Netfilter policy check can be
      enabled/disabled easily via psad.conf.
    - Enhanced -D output to include "uname -a" and "perl -V" output.
    - Added ENABLE_RENEW_BLOCK_EMAILS to allow whether renew emails are sent
      for auto-blocked addresses.

psad-1.4.4 (11/27/2005):
    - Added MAC address reporting in psad email alerts.  This feature is
      enabled via a new config keyword "ENABLE_MAC_ADDR_REPORTING".
    - Added --fw-rm-block-ip <ip> option to allow IP addresses to be removed
      from the auto-blocking chains from the command line.
    - Updated command line firewall arguments to write commands to the
      AUTO_IPT_SOCK domain socket.
    - Added the ability to specify ports and port ranges to auto_dl file.
    - Added --force-mod-install command line argument to installer to force
      perl modules used by psad to be installed within /usr/lib/psad
      regardless of whether they already exist in the system perl tree.
    - Bugfix in the installer to seek() to the end of the fwdata file
    - Bugfix for psad repeatedly trying to remove the same IP address(es)
      from the auto-blocking chains.
      instead of reading the entire thing into memory.
    - Added the ability to truncate the fwdata file via a new configuration
      keyword "TRUNCATE_FWDATA" (this is enabled by default).
    - Bugfix in auto-blocking mode for deleting AUTO_IPT_SOCK when a HUP
      signal is received.
    - Bugfix for parsing Netfilter policies that contain ULOG logging rules
      instead of the standard LOG target.
    - Removed the smtpdaemon requirement in the RPM because psad might be
      configured to not send email alerts.

psad-1.4.3 (09/27/2005):
    - Bugfixes for auto-blocking code.  Timeouts should be handled
      properly, including cached IP addresses in the auto_blocked_iptables
      file that are referenced upon psad startup.  Communication with the
      running psad is performed over a Unix domain socket in --fw-block
      mode.
    - Bugfix to seek to the end of the fwdata file instead of reading the
      entire thing into memory and then looking for newly written logging
      messages.  This drastically reduces the amount of memory required
      by psad.
    - Updated to only display psad chains if --verbose is set
    - Updated to automatically flush the psad auto-response Netfilter chains
      at start time (subject to a new config keyword "FLUSH_IPT_AT_INIT").

psad-1.4.2 (07/15/2005):
    - Dependency bugfixes for mail binary.
    - Bugfix for various IGNORE_* keywords not being honored.
    - Bugfix for not timing out blocked IP addresses from a previous run.
    - Updated to version 0.2 of the IPTables::ChainMgr module.
    - Updated to not truncate the fwdata file upon psad startup.
    - Added --fw-dump which produces a sanitized (i.e. no IP addresses)
      version of the local Netfilter policy.  Also added --fw-include-ips
      to (optionally) not sanitize IPs/nets.  Note that the 0.0.0.0 and
      0.0.0.0/0 IPs/nets are not sanitized since they give no useful
      information about specific IPs/nets.
    - Added ulogd data collection mode.
    - Bugfix for FW_MSG_SEARCH default (at least "DROP" is included now
      even if FW_SEARCH_ALL is set to "N").
    - Bugfix for non-network address for subnet specified with --fw-block.
    - Bugfix for multiple --fw-block IPs/nets.
    - Added README.SYSLOG (Francois Marier contributed the content).
    - Made email alert prefixes (such as "[psad-alert]") customizable via
      psad.conf.

psad-1.4.1 (03/12/2005):
    - Updated to Snort-2.3 rules in the snort_rules directory.
    - Re-worked syslog installation portion of install.pl.  The user will
      always be prompted to enter the syslog daemon now, and also added
      the --syslog-conf arg to allow the config file path to be specified
      on the install.pl command line.
    - Bugfix in install.pl for using IP address instead of network address
      of directly connected subnets.
    - Updated to version 4.6.23 of the whois client.
    - Bugfix for distinguishing OPT field associated with --log-tcp-options
      vs. --log-ip-options.
    - Bugfix for syslog format that may not include the "kernel:" tag.
    - Applied patch to only install perl modules that are not already
      installed (Blair Zajac).
    - Bugfix for the psad version number that is sent in DShield alerts.
    - Updated Psad module directory structure to be consistent with current
      versions of perl (5.8.x).
    - Added IPTables::ChainMgr module.
    - Completely re-worked the Netfilter auto-blocking code to use
      IPTables::ChainMgr functions so that auto-generated rules are placed
      in chains created by psad.
    - Added IPT_AUTO_CHAIN keyword in psad.conf which is used to define the
      set of chains to which auto-generated Netfilter rules are added.
    - Added --fw-list-auto to display the contents of psad Netfilter
      chains.
    - Added the ability to import an IP into the Netfilter auto-blocking
      chains from the command line with --fw-block-ip.  This allows psad to
      apply its timeout mechanism against such IPs/nets.
    - Added the ability to ignore packets based on input interface with
      IGNORE_INTERFACES in psad.conf.
    - Re-worked auto_dl code, better hash design and searching function.
    - Removed dependency on sendmail command unless DShield alerting is
      enabled and a DShield user id is specified.
    - Added ALERTING_METHODS keyword in the file alert.conf to allow either
      syslog or email alerts (or both) to be disabled.  Psad and psadwatchd
      reference this file.

psad-1.4.0 (11/26/2004):
    - Added p0f-style passive OS fingerprinting through the use of the OPT
      field in iptables log messages (which is only logged through the use
      of the --log-tcp-options command line arg to iptables).
    - Bugfix for iptables log messages that include tcp sequence numbers
      (see the iptables --log-tcp-sequence command line argument).
    - Bugfix for O_RDONLY open flag when kmsgsd receives a HUP signal.

psad-1.3.4 (10/17/2004):
    - Bugfix for init script directory on Slackware systems.
    - Bugfix for null prefix counters.
    - Added --whois-analysis argument since whois lookups are now disabled
      by default when running in analysis (-A) mode.
    - Updated psad_init() to rework setup() and import orderings vs.
      --fw-analyze and --Benchmark modes.
    - Added bidirectional iptables auto-blocking support for all chains
      except for the INPUT and OUTPUT chains.
    - Better syslog message support when run in auto-blocking mode.
    - Added iptables auto-block rules section to --Status output.
    - Added init script for Fedora systems.
    - Added default_log() function to IPTables::Parse.  This function
      parses user defined chains in an effort to find default logging
      rules.
    - Added EMAIL_LIMIT_STATUS_MSG to control whether or not psad sends a
      status email when the PSAD_EMAIL_LIMIT threshold has been reached by
      an IP address.
    - Added ENABLE_SCAN_ARCHIVE to control whether or not psad archives old
      scan data within /var/log/psad/scan_archive at start time.

psad-1.3.3 (09/09/2004):
    - Fixed __WARN__ and __DIE__ exception handlers so that they
      reference global message variables.
    - Fixed auto danger level assignments.  Network auto assignments as
      well as per-protocol assignments work now.
    - Added SYSLOG_DAEMON variable to define which syslog daemon is running
      on the underlying system instead of just guessing.
    - Added the ability to ignore both ranges and specific ports/protocols
      with a new variable IGNORE_PORTS in psad.conf.
    - Bugfix to make sure email addresses are separated by spaces when
      Psad::sendmail() is called.
    - Bugfix for ipt_prefix counters not being parsed correct at import
      time.
    - Removed exclude_auto_ignore_ip() since this function was made
      unnecessary by newly rewritten auto-assign code.
    - Bugfix for Text::Wrap calls in install.pl uninstall() routine.
    - Bugfix for using --no-fw-search-all even when FW_SEARCH_ALL is
      set to "Y".
    - Removed extraneous ".." and "**" chars from syslog messages, and
      updated to use [+] prefix strings.
    - Moved init scripts into init-scripts directory within source tree.
    - Removed dependency on Bit::Vector (psad does not seem to make use
      of any Date::Calc functions that require it).
    - Wrapped copy() and move() calls with "or die()" to make them
      safer in install.pl.
    - Added check for existing psad process in install.pl.
    - Updated to a new psad email alert subject format.  Prefixes of
      "[psad-alert]", "[psad-error]", and "[psad-status]" are used now.
    - Permissions fixes with umask() setting in /var/log/psad, permissions
      fixes for files in /etc/psad at install time.

psad-1.3.2 (06/25/2004):
    - Removed FW_MSG_SEARCH from psad.conf, and created a new config
      file "fw_search.conf" that both psad and kmsgsd use to get the
      FW_MSG_SEARCH definition(s).
    - Added default mode of parsing all iptables messages instead of
      just those that contain specific search strings.  A new config
      variable "FW_SEARCH_ALL" was added to fw_search.conf that
      controls this mode.
    - Updated psad and kmsgsd so that multiple firewall search strings
      can be specified through multiple FW_MSG_SEARCH variables in
      fw_search.conf.
    - Added iptables chain and logging-prefix tracking for current
      scan interval in email alerts.
    - Added protocol-specific auto-danger level assignments.
    - Added total scan source and destination IP address counters in
      --Status output.
    - Added number of email alerts sent and OS guess in default
      --Status output.  The output is getting wide now, so there is
      also a new option --status-brief that will remove the alerts
      sent and OS guess columns.
    - Added getopt() command line arg parsing to kmsgsd with two new
      options "-c" (for config file path) and "-k" (for fw_search.conf
      path).
    - Made iptables parsing code into its own script "fwcheck_psad"
      that gets called by psad.
    - Added Dshield stats summary to --Status output.
    - Bugfix for auto-ignore IP addresses and networks being missed.
    - Made parsing of ifconfig output language independent (should
      handle French now for example).
    - Removed "psad_" prefix on files psad_signatures, psad_auto_ips,
      psad_posf, and psad_icmp_types in /etc/psad/.
    - Updated to version 4.6.14 of the whois client.

psad-1.3.1 (12/25/2003):
    - Added the ability to import /var/log/psad/<ip> directories
      back into memory so scan data remains persistent across
      psad restarts or system reboots.
    - Added --Analyze-msgs to run psad in analysis mode against an
      iptables logfile (/var/log/psad/fwdata by default).  The logfile
      path can be changed with --messages-file.
    - Added icmp type and code validation against RFC 792.
    - Bugfix for being too strict with FW_MSG_SEARCH.
    - Added port ranges for tcp and udp scans in <ip>/<dst>_packet_ctr.
    - Added <ip>/<dst>_start_time and <ip>/os_guess.
    - Bugfix for missing --no-signatures code.
    - Updated to Snort-2.1 signatures.

psad-1.3 (11/30/2003):
    - Replaced all signatures in psad_signatures with updated snort
      rules.
    - Added support for source and destination ip addresses in
      signature matching code.  A new variable "HOME_NET" makes this
      possible.
    - Added support for the iptables output chain.
    - Added chain tracking for all signatures.
    - Replaced match_fastsigs() with two new routines for tcp and
      udp signature matching that don't autovivify hash keys.
    - Removed support for ipchains.
    - Added support for metalog.
    - Removed all "Undefined Code" signatures from psad_signatures.
    - Re-worked %auto_blocked_ips hash and corresponding blocking
      routines.  This (hopefully) fixes a restart bug seen on older
      systems such as those that are still running versions of perl
      less than 5.6.
    - Re-worked firewall policy parsing routines.  Chains that have
      a default policy of DROP are handled properly now.
    - Bugfix for missing NULL char in kmsgsd.c.
    - Updated scan alerting format.  Put current interval protocol
      status before source and destination addresses.
    - Buffer overflow fix in kmsgsd.c for size of buf[MAX_LINE_BUF]
      buffer in read() call.
    - Added --no-kmsgsd option to aid in psad --debug mode.

psad-1.2.4 (10/15/2003):
    - Added danger level to subject line in email alerts.
    - Removed diskmond altogether since psad now handles disk space
      thresholds directly.  This allows filehandles to be handled
      properly.
    - Added auto_block_ignore_ip() to prevent 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1,
      and local interface ips from being included in auto blocking
      routines.
    - Added Bit::Vector module to stop installation warnings from
      Date::Calc.
    - Made get_local_ips() called periodically since local addresses
      may change (dhcp, etc.).
    - Added installation code and init script for Gentoo Linux.
    - Bugfix for INIT_DIR in uninstall() routine in install.pl.
    - Bugfix for auto-blocking loop after timeouts are hit.
    - Added --status-dl [N] to display status information only for
      those scans that reach at least [N].

psad-1.2.3 (09/12/2003):
    - Added interface tracking for scans.
    - Bugfix for not opening /etc/hosts.deny the right way in
      tcpwr_block().
    - Bugfix for psadfifo path in syslog-ng config.
    - Better format for summary stats section in email alerts.
    - Bugfix for INIT_DIR path on non-RedHat systems.
    - Bugfix for gzip path.
    - Make Psad.pm installed last of all perl modules installed
      by psad.
    - Added additional call to incr_syscall_ctr() in psadwatchd.c

psad-1.2.2 (08/24/2003):
    - psad is finally available as an RPM package.
    - Added chain tracking for iptables.
    - Added chain counts to --Status output.
    - Bugfix for psad not taking into account multiple scan
      destinations.
    - Reworked auto-blocking code for both tcpwrappers and
      iptables.  Lines added to /etc/hosts.deny will no longer be
      duplicated.  Added IPTABLES_AUTO_RULENUM and
      IPCHAINS_AUTO_RULENUM so auto rules can be inserted at a
      configurable point within iptables and ipchains policies.
    - Psad now installs all perl modules within /usr/lib/psad.
    - Removed /var/log/psad/<ip>/scanlog file since it was wasting
      too much disk.
    - Made psad, psadwatchd, and diskmond take the machine hostname
      from their respective config files.  This makes installation
      via the rpm easier, and is generally cleaner.
    - Added scan destination in --Status output.
    - Added --status-sort-dl (the default status output is now
      sorted by ip address by default).

psad-1.2.1 (07/11/2003):
    - Bugfix for multiple processes being spawned by psadwatchd
      due to lack of proper config variables in the new split
      daemon config files.
    - Bugfix for old scan messages being regenerated if a HUP
      signal is received.
    - Bugfix for incorrectly calculating disk utilization in
      diskmond.c.
    - Extended install.pl to include compression for archived
      files in /etc/psad.
    - Added preserve questions in install.pl for the psad
      signature and auto ips files.
    - Bugfix for --USR1 command line switch not mapping to the
      correct subroutine.
    - Bugfix for psad man page missing the pipe character in
      psadfifo line for syslog.conf.

psad-1.2 (06/18/2003):
    - Added passive OS fingerprinting based on packet ttl, length,
      tos, and id fields.
    - Added dshield.org alerting capability.
    - Added exec_external_script() for external script execution.
    - Added auto blocked timeouts.
    - Implemented config re-imports via HUP signals in a manner
      similar to various other system daemons (sysylog, apache
      etc.)
    - Better --Status output that shows packet counts per protocol
      for each ip.
    - Added --ip-status for more verbose status output for a
      particular ip address.
    - Added config preservation code to install.pl.
    - Added Psad::psyslog().
    - Split psad.conf into a separate config file for each of the
      four psad daemons.
    - Completely re-worked the auto blocking code (made dedicated
      files for iptables and ipchains block methods).
    - Added danger level hash.
    - Minor code cleanups (shorter hash keys, etc.).

psad-1.1.1 (04/26/2003):
    - Bugfix for incorrect usage of %scan hash keys associated
      with tcp/udp when the current protocol is icmp.
    - Bugfix for being too strict on iptable default log string.
    - Reworked USR1 signal handler so the Data::Dumper function
      call is made in the main part of the psad code.
    - Added a startup message for psad.
    - Minor bugfix for leading whitespace in auto_ips.

psad-1.1 (04/20/2003):
    - Added the IPTables::Parse module for better processing of
      the iptables ruleset.
    - Added --snort-sids so that iptables messages generated by
      fwsnort can be included in alerts.  Such alerts now include
      the content fields of packets (fwsnort uses the iptables
      string match module).
    - Added the ability to specify entire networks in the auto
      ips file through the use of the Net::IPv4Addr module.
    - Better logging format that reinstates the current interval,
      and adds an "overall stats" section that includes packet
      counters per protocol.
    - Removed the PROTO hash key since it was unnecesssary.
    - Better benchmarking code.
    - Bug fix for incorrectly looking for the "MAC" string in
      iptables messages that could have been generated by the
      FORWARD chain.

psad-1.0 (02/27/2003):
    - Added --Benchmark and --packets command line options to support
      psad benchmarking.
    - Bugfix for improperly detecting NULL scans.
    - Completely redesigned website.

psad-1.0.0-pre4 (11/26/2002):
    - Rewrote kmsgsd and psadwatchd in C.
