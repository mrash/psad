Prerequisites:
--------------

Perl version 5.000 or higher, and an ANSI C compiler. (!)
                                     ^^^^^^
Module "Carp::Clan" version 5.3 or higher.

Optionally, module "Storable" version 2.21 or newer.

Note that in order to compile Perl modules which contain
C (and/or XS) code (such as this one), you always HAVE
to use the very same compiler your Perl itself was compiled
with.

Many vendors nowadays ship their operating system already
comprising a precompiled version of Perl. Many times the
compilers used to compile this version of Perl are not
available to or not usually used by the users of these
operating systems.

In such cases building this module (or any other Perl
module containing C and/or XS code) will not work. You
will either have to get the compiler which was used to
compile Perl itself (see for example the section "Compiler:"
in the output of the command "perl -V"), or to build
your own Perl with the compiler of your choice (which
also allows you to take advantage of the various compile-
time switches Perl offers).

Note that Sun Solaris and Red Hat Linux frequently were
reported to suffer from this kind of problem.

Moreover, you usually cannot build any modules under
Windows 95/98 since the Win 95/98 command shell doesn't
support the "&&" operator. You will need the Windows NT
command shell ("cmd.exe") or the "4DOS" shell to be
installed on your Windows 95/98 system first. Note that
Windows NT, Windows 2000 and Windows XP are not affected
and just work fine. I don't know about Windows Vista and
Windows 7, however.

Note that ActiveState provides precompiled binaries of
this module for their Win32 port of Perl ("ActivePerl")
on their web site, which you should be able to install
simply by typing "ppm install Bit-Vector" in your MS-DOS
command shell (but note the "-" instead of "::" in the
package name!). This also works under Windows 95/98 (!).

If your firewall prevents "ppm" from downloading
this package, you can also download it manually from
http://www.activestate.com/ppmpackages/5.005/zips/ or
http://www.activestate.com/ppmpackages/5.6/zips/.
Follow the installation instructions included in
the "zip" archive.


Preliminary steps for use with Perl prior to version 5.002:
-----------------------------------------------------------

Edit the file "Makefile.PL" and change the line

    'VERSION_FROM'      => 'Vector.pm',
to
    'VERSION'           => '7.4',

Then edit the file "Vector.pm" and change the line

    bootstrap Bit::Vector $VERSION;
to
    bootstrap Bit::Vector;

Also edit the file "t/00____version.t" and change the line

    use Bit::Vector 7.4;

to

    use Bit::Vector;

Finally, edit the file "Vector.xs" and delete the line

    PROTOTYPES: DISABLE


Preliminary steps for use with ActiveState's port of Perl 5:
------------------------------------------------------------

(For the Win32 platform)

Edit the file "Makefile.PL" and remove all of the "#" characters
which currently comment out the lines involved with the setting
of the attributes "ABSTRACT", "AUTHOR" and "CAPI".


Installation:
-------------

=============================================================================
ALWAYS unpack and build Perl modules OUTSIDE the Perl source and installation
tree! (You might otherwise inadvertently corrupt your Perl installation!)
=============================================================================

Quick installation guide for experienced users:
-----------------------------------------------

    UNIX:                 Win32/Borland C++:      Win32/MS Visual C++:
    =====                 ==================      ====================

    % perl Makefile.PL    % perl Makefile.PL      % perl Makefile.PL
    % make                % dmake                 % nmake
    % make test           % dmake test            % nmake test
    % make install        % dmake install         % nmake install

Detailed installation guide:
----------------------------

 1) Change directory to the directory that has been created by unpacking this
    package ("cd Bit-Vector-7.4").

 2) Type "perl Makefile.PL" (or whatever the name and path of your Perl 5
    binary is).

    This will create a "Makefile" with the appropriate parameters for your
    system (for instance, where the install directories are, and so on).

    See "man ExtUtils::MakeMaker" or "perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for
    other useful options to this command, like setting a different
    installation PREFIX.

 3) Type "make".

    (For installation under Windows NT/95, use "dmake" (Borland C++) or
    "nmake" (MS Visual C++) instead!)

    This will create a dynamically linkable library file that will be linked
    to Perl later, at runtime, provided your system supports dynamic linking.

    Please refer to the MakeMaker documentation for instructions on how
    to build a new Perl with statically linked libraries (invoke "perldoc
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker" for this), if your system does NOT support dynamic
    linking!

    Should you encounter any compiler warnings or errors (like the redefi-
    nition of certain types already defined by your system), please contact
    me via e-mail at <STBEY@cpan.org>, sending me your compiler output
    (both STDOUT and STDERR). Thank you!

    ======================================================================
       BEWARE that you need an ANSI C compiler in order to successfully
       compile this package!
    ======================================================================

    Also note that problems may arise with the c89 compiler of HP, although
    it allegedly supports ANSI C!

    I recommend the GNU C compiler ("gcc"), which is freely available on
    the Internet (see ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ and mirror sites thereof).

    (HP users are strongly recommended to install the GNU assembler "gas"
    first before installing the GNU C compiler "gcc", according to GNU.)

    Should you get the error messages

    Vector.c: 15: Unable to find include file 'EXTERN.h'.
    Vector.c: 16: Unable to find include file 'perl.h'.
    Vector.c: 17: Unable to find include file 'XSUB.h'.

    then edit the file "Makefile.PL" and add a line similar to the
    following so that it points to your Perl 5 distribution tree:

    'INC'       => '-I/usr/ctr/dlt/private/perl/perl5.003',

    Then start over with the generation of the "Makefile" at 2).

 4) Now issue "make test" (or "dmake test" or "nmake test", respectively).

    The output should look somewhat like this:

    PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /v/guest/sw/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"
    "-e" "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')" t/*.t
    t/00_____version.t .. ok
    t/01_________new.t .. ok
    t/02_____destroy.t .. ok
    t/03__operations.t .. ok
    t/04___functions.t .. ok
    t/05______primes.t .. ok
    t/06______subset.t .. ok
    t/07_____compare.t .. ok
    t/08______resize.t .. ok

    t/15_________add.t .. ok
    t/16____subtract.t .. ok
    t/17_________gcd.t .. ok
    t/28___chunklist.t .. ok
    t/30__overloaded.t .. ok
    t/40___auxiliary.t .. ok
    t/50_freeze_thaw.t .. ok
    t/51_file_nstore.t .. ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=23, Tests=91963, 16 wallclock secs (13.63 usr  0.23 sys +  2.91 cusr  0.56 csys = 17.34 CPU)
    Result: PASS

    (Note that the exact number of tests will depend on the number of bits
     of a machine word/an unsigned long on your system!)

 5) At last, type "make install" (or "dmake install", "nmake install").

 6) Now you can run the "primes.pl" demo program from the "examples" sub-
    directory, for instance. Start it with "perl examples/primes.pl" (or
    whatever the name and path of your Perl 5 binary is).

    It will ask you to enter a number which will serve as an upper limit for
    the calculation of all prime numbers up to that limit, using the algorithm
    known as "The Sieve of Erathostenes".

    On my machine (SUN SPARCstation 20/61), calculating all the prime numbers
    up to one million takes about 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes (depending
    on the load) when the algorithm is programmed in Perl. If the internal
    method "Primes()" is used instead (implemented in C), the same machine
    only takes about 1 second for this task.

 7) Share and enjoy!
