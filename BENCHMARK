Kmsgsd Benchmarks:

The basic strategy in benchmarking kmsgsd is to get syslogd to write kern.info
messages (which include ipchains and iptables log messages) to the /var/log/psadfifo
named pipe.  Kmsgsd will then read the messages out of the pipe as quickly as
possible and write them to /var/log/psad/fwdata.  To calculate how fast kmsgsd is
we then compare the number of newly written firewall messages to /var/log/messages
with the number of messages kmsgsd was able to write to /var/log/psad/fwdata in the
same time frame.  To generate lots of firewall "deny" messages we first make sure we
have the firewall "default log and deny" policy loaded, and then proceed to scan the
firewall first from a machine that is linked via a 100MB ethernet segment connected 
directly to the firewall with a crossover cable, and second with a scan against the 
loopback address from the firewall itself.  The second scan will eliminate any 
network latency from slowing the scan down.

TEST 1:
- Scanning machine: PIII 700mhz, kernel 2.2.18
- Target machine: PIII 700mhz, kernel 2.4.0
- Ethernet: 100MB connection between the two machines.
- Perl: 5.005_03
- Scan command line: nmap -sX -p 5000-60000 <target_machine>
- Approximate average number of iptables "DENY" messages printed to
  /var/log/messages: 4400
- Approximate average number of iptables messages caught by kmsgsd and
  printed to /var/log/psad/fwdata: 4325

Results:  kmsgsd catches over 98% of all firewall messages that are
  written by klogd to /var/log/messages.  The remaining two percent that
  are missed is probably due to context switching overhead and/or slowness
  of Perl itself, and not much can be done about that (except re-writing it
  in C of course).

TEST 2:
- We scan the loopback interface on the firewall.
- PIII 500mhz, 128 MB ram, kernel 2.4.0
- Perl 5.005_03
- Scan command line: nmap -sX -p 5000-60000 127.0.0.1
- Number of iptables "DENY" messages printed to /var/log/messages: 14810
- Number of iptables messages caught by kmsgsd and written to 
  /var/log/psad/fwdata: 14847

Results:  These results are a bit surprising since kmsgsd caught more
  messages in /var/log/psad/fwdata than syslog could write to 
  /var/log/messages, but perhaps syslog can write more quickly to a named pipe 
  (in this case to /var/log/psadfifo) than it can to a file (/var/log/messages) 
  since probably would not have seek() to the end of the file to know where to 
  write each message.  Hence it would appear that kmsgsd can keep up with just 
  about anything thrown at it (for home users anyway).  During this test kmsgsd
  had a maximum CPU utilization of 5.6% and a maximum memory utilization of
  0.8%

Psad Benchmarks:

To benchmark psad we need to generate lots of messages in the fwdata file.  Normally
this is the responsibility of kmsgsd, but to perform an effective test of just how fast
psad is able to parse lots of firewall "deny" messages, we first create a large file
that contains 10,000 lines of the firewall messages, then we execute "cat /dev/null > 
/var/log/psad/fwdata", and lastly we copy the large file to /var/log/psad/fwdata. 
Psad then detects that 10,000 packets were just denied by the firewall and starts to 
process the lines one by one.

- PIII 500mhz, 128MB ram, kernel 2.4.0
- Perl 5.005_03

Results:  Psad was able to process all 10,000 lines of firewall messages in
  approximately 16 seconds with a peak CPU and memory utilization of 99.7% and 
  3.8% respectively.
