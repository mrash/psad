        modify Makefile.PL to bypass missing 'pod2text'

1.50  Tue Apr  9 12:02:34 PDT 2013
	changed Makefile.PL to check for config.h when building for XS
	with 'gcc', try building with 'cc', and check again.
	If config.h is not found, force Pure Perl mode.

	Kill XS in winduhs and Darwin, both of which misbehave when compiling XS code

1.49  Wed Apr  3 10:52:24 PDT 2013
	modify Makefile.PL to better detect 'winduhs'

1.48 Tue Oct  2 12:36:11 PDT 2012
	correct incorrect format for IPv6 embedded IPv4 addresses
	in InetBase v0.8

1.47  Fri Aug 10 11:46:18 PDT 2012

	update documentation in InetBase v0.06

1.45  Fri Nov 11 13:20:32 PST 2011
	break out the code in InetBase v0.05 that expands short IPv4 
	addresses into dotquad format to account for broken BSD 
	implementations of inet_aton and gethostbyname that do 
	not recognize the short format. EXPORT this as sub 'fillIPv4'

	in Util.pm, add 'fillIPv4' to calls to gethostbyname to 
	work around broken inet_aton and gethostbyname implementations
	in certain BSD implementations

1.44  Wed Nov  2 19:15:31 PDT 2011
	improve inet_aton in InetBase v0.04 to overcome broken

	EXPORT_OK array, modify InetBase.pm v0.02 to work around this.

1.41  Sat Oct 15 17:26:21 PDT 2011
	add inet_pton, inet_ntop, AF_INET, AF_INET6

	modify inet_n2dx and inet_n2ad to 
	recognize the new 128 bit IPv4 format
	::FFFF:FFFF:0:0

	replace isIPv4 with a pure perl version for portablity

	split the following into NetAddr::IP::InetBase v0.01
	to provide better long term support for IPv6
        inet_aton
        inet_ntoa
        ipv6_aton
        ipv6_n2x
        ipv6_n2d
        inet_any2n
        inet_n2dx
        inet_n2ad
        inet_ntop
        inet_pton
        packzeros
        isIPv4
        isNewIPv4
        isAnyIPv4
        AF_INET
        AF_INET6

	correction to use of package lexicals

	thanks to mishikal@yahoo.com for spotting the bug and to
	Mark Martinec mark.martinec+ama...@ijs.si for the solution.

1.35  Tue Nov 16 16:28:37 PST 2010
	naip_gethostbyname modified to return undef instead of 
	0 (zero) on failure

	thanks to Terry Cassidy enaudishaylee@tc17.com for the bug report

	move sub's ipv6_n2d and ipv6_n2x to non-autosplit portion
	of module to eliminate warnings during autosplit of "our" variables

	thanks to Nicholas Bamber <nicholas@periapt.co.uk>

	In Util.xs, 
	changed netswap() to postincrement 
        *a++ = to *a and added increment after save to mollify some
        picky compilers that return possible undefined behavior.

        changed type of _128x10 to 'void'

1.31  Tue Jun  9 10:31:11 PDT 2009
	ferret out shell value for Makefile.PL when calling
	./configure for systems where the 'x' bit gets lost
	due to bug in Archive::Tar

	CC before using Perl's default compiler

	set uninitialized "carry" in XS bin2bcd to zero

1.27  Tue Dec  9 12:00:08 PST 2008
	revised UtilPP v1.7 to work around perl 5.8.4 
	failures with certain @_ operations of goto &sub...
	see perl bug [ 23429]. Unfortunately, perl-5.8.4 is
	the distribution of choice for many solaris boxes

1.26  Fri Nov 28 23:19:01 PST 2008
	revised XS code to be full re-entrant... thread safe.
	removed all traces of mutex locks

	Clean up Makefile.PL to check actual required link
	libraries against the perl build for consistency

1.23  Sun Nov  2 10:10:38 PST 2008

	and lets get the version number right since it appears
	that it was up-rev'd at some point to 1.xx

0.20  Mon Oct  6 13:07:34 PDT 2008
	clear build bug for Win32

0.19  Sat Sep 27 13:36:58 PDT 2008

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1

0.18  Sun Aug  6 10:48:25 PDT 2006
	correct shiftleft documentation

0.16  Sun Jun 25 16:13:00 PDT 2006
	fixed ->new() issues with long digit strings ->new('::fffff')
	and non hex digits ->new('::foo').
	Thanks to Radoslaw Zielinski <radek42@gmail.com>
	for spotting those bugs

0.15  Tue Jun 13 14:42:34 PDT 2006
	UtilPP.pm v0.07 & Util.xs 'shiftleft' so that the original
	argument is returned when the shift count is '0' or missing

0.14  Tue Jun  6 08:37:01 PDT 2006
	add logic to check LIBS => [-lfiles]
	individually. ExtUtils::xxx does a bad job and
	leaves libs that do not exist in the list
	which causes 'siteconf' to blow up on missing libs
	on perl 5.053 (and probably others)

0.13  Tue Jun  6 08:33:11 PDT 2006
	added to xs file, 'hopefully' to allow build on windoze platforms

0.12  Tue Jun  6 08:21:12 PDT 2006

	are not used in PurePerl mode

0.11  Mon Jun  5 14:45:09 PDT 2006

0.10  Sat Jun  3 19:07:51 PDT 2006
	add site configuration to supply u_intxx_t vars
	for Sun OS and others that don't have them

0.09  Sun May  7 18:06:43 PDT 2006
	UtilPP.pm v0.06, removed unnecessary pack(unpack) sequences
	to speed up ipv4->6, ipv6->4 conversions

0.08  Wed Apr 26 18:33:12 PDT 2006
	correct documentation error
	add ipv6to4

0.07  Sun Apr 23 16:11:56 PDT 2006

0.06  Tue Apr 18 16:50:53 PDT 2006
	add ipv4to6, mask4to6 to Util.pm and UtilPP.pm v0.03

	failed to update README during build

0.04  Wed Apr 12 15:43:33 PDT 2006
	add Util_IS.pm to guarantee that the XS lib is not
	loaded if a previous incarnation of the same version
	has previously been installed on the system and the
	module is built with -noxs

	added UtilPP for Pure Perl functionality for the
	WinTel folks that don't have gcc on their systems

0.01  Tue Mar 28 16:42:44 PST 2006
	initial release
