      VARIABLES" section of the man page was the result.

Jason Czerak
    - Found and submitted a fix for a bug in which an IP would not be
      ignored even if it was given a 0 danger level in psad_auto_ips.
    - Suggested using the PREROUTING iptables chain along with "-t mangle"
      for the auto-blocking code.

Colin Rose
    - Discovered and helped troubleshoot a bug introduced when psad and

    - Suggested bugfix for missing pipe character in psad man page for
      psadfifo line in syslog.conf.

Jeff Lunglhofer
    - Suggested bugfix for packet counters and multiple scan destinations,
      bugfix for duplicate lines in auto-blocking files, and suggested
      feature by which psad can add auto blocking firewall rules at
      arbitrary points within a policy.

Ruben Vanhoutte
    - Bugfix for incorrect path to psadfifo in syslog.ng config.

Stefan Divjak
    - Suggested that psad ignore addresses such as 0.0.0.0, 127.0.0.1, and
      local interface ips from auto blocking routines.

      be properly assigned by the /etc/psad/snort_rule_dl file.

Kenneth Grande
    - Suggested protocol-specific thresholds for email alerts.

Lenny Cartier
    - Wrote a spec file for Mandrake Linux.  An rpm built from this spec
      file is in the user contribs section of the Mandrake site now.

    - Helped troubleshoot -pre releases of psad-1.3.2.
    - Provided a system on which to troubleshoot psad-1.3.3 (this
      facilitated the isolation of the pp_match bug to an older version perl
      on SuSE 8).

Joshua Jensen
    - Found bug with the manner in which fwcheck_psad.pl was being called
      from psad (improperly passing --no-fw-search-all option even if
      FW_SEARCH_ALL was set to "Y").

Mate Wierdl
    - Found bug in EMAIL_ADDRESSES format (psad needed to allow addresses
      separated by commas).
    - Submitted patch for new init-scripts directory for psad.spec file.
    - Contributed patch for building the psad RPM on x86_64 platforms.

      keyword was the result.
    - Suggested adding various psad docs (CREDITS, ChangeLog, INSTALL,
      etc.) to be installed by the psad rpm
    - Suggested the ability to have psadwatchd not send emails even if psad
      dies and has to be restarted.

Michael Hadjimichael
    - Bug report for syslog format that does not necessarily have the
      "kernel:" tag.

Blair Zajac
    - Submitted patch to not install perl modules in that are already
      installed in the system perl lib tree (this was originally submitted
      as a patch for fwknop).
    - Found bug with perl module file paths and naming convention (this bug
      resulted in some modules being needlessly installed).  This find was
      originally for fwknop.
    - Suggested the -O optimization in Makefile (originally suggested for the
      fwknop project).

Troy Swaine
    - Suggested a command line interface to block IP addresses.  The result
      is the --fw-block-ip argument.

Najib Bakari
    - Pointed out that sendmail is not usually required to run psad.  The
      result is the alert.conf file with the ALERTING_METHODS keyword,
      which also gets referenced by psadwatchd.

Sam Weiss
    - Suggested that psad default FW_MSG_SEARCH to "DROP" if no strings are
      defined in fw_search.conf.

Francois Marier
    - Contributed REAME.SYSLOG content to help troubleshoot psad and syslog.

Nathan Colt
    - Suggested customizable email subjects.

Alex Luna
    - Suggested ULOG support.

Torkel Hasle
    - Suggested the ability to assign danger levels based on ports in
      addition to the protocol in auto_dl.  Suggested better sweep detection
      by calculating scan danger levels over all destinations (i.e. 5 packets
      to different destinations should trigger danger level 1).

SiO
    - Reported bug with zero masks in auto_dl file.

Jeroen Vermeulen
    - Suggested that psad collect and report errors that are returned by
      broken iptables commands to the user. This resulted in a redesign of the
      IPTables::ChaingMgr module to collect both stdout and stderr from all
      iptables commands.
    - Found bug where IPTABLES_AUTO_RULENUM misled the user into thinking that
      it governed where the jump rule into a custom chain is added within the
      calling chain.  This resulted in the IPT_AUTO_CHAIN{n} variables being
      updated to support the rule position for both the jump rule and any new
      rules within the chain.

Adam Mottershead
    - Suggested the ability to disable psad email alerts about auto-blocking
      events.

Richard B\351neyt
    - Suggested syslog-ng enhancement to allow a custom source path for
      /proc/kmsg to be defined for the psadfifo file.

Philip Lawrence
    - Contributed patch to fix module path import bug.  This resulted in the
      psad-2.0.1 release.

Stefano Harding
    - Reported bug that caused psad to not acquire iptables data on systems
      running syslog-ng when there is no "source" definition for /proc/kmsg.

Aki Tuomi
    - Reported bug where iptables might report '0' instead of 'all' for the
      protocol under the -nL output.

pyllyukko
    - Contributed the psad.SlackBuild script for building psad on Slackware
      systems.
    - Suggested that the psad.spec file respect the %_initrddir RPM macro.
    - Suggested configurable syslog facility and priority settings.
    - Contributed a suspicious iptables log message that contained a broken
      set of TCP options.  This exposed a bug where psad would consume all
      available memory on the system and would have to be killed.  The result
      is an additional check to ensure that the length fields parsed from TCP
      options are greater than one byte; otherwise, the TLV encoding doesn't
      work out properly.

Christian Lyra
    - Found off-by-one error in number of email alerts that are reported under
      --Status output.

James Neff
    - Provided solution for getting psad to run in Fedora 8 systems by
      pointing psad at the /etc/rsyslog.conf file.

Franck Joncourt
    - Performed analysis of locale settings for fwknop installer and suggested
      using the LC_ALL environmental variable instead of the LANG variable
      (which is superseded by LC_* vars).

Erik Heidt
    - Submitted patch to fix fwsnort sid reporting w.r.t. ending newline
      chars.
    - Reported iptables log prefix bug where timestamps that include spaces
      where not being excluded even when IGNORE_KERNEL_TIMESTAMP is set to
      "Y".

Andrew Kaplan
    - Reported the inability of an older version of the bundled whois client
      to query the whois information associated with certain IP addresses.
      Updating to whois-4.7.26 solved the problem.

j.bakshi
    - Reported a bug where IPT_SYSLOG_FILE was not being honored in -A
      (analyze) mode.
