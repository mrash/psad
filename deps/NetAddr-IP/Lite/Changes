Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP::Lite

1.41  Fri Nov 11 19:23:11 PST 2011
	up rev for documentation update
        update documentation in InetBase v0.06

1.40  Fri Nov 11 13:20:32 PST 2011
	add call to InetBase::fillIPv4 to all uses of gethostbyname

	break out the code in InetBase v0.05 that expands short IPv4 
	addresses into dotquad format to account for broken BSD 
	implementations of inet_aton and gethostbyname that do 
	not recognize the short format. EXPORT this as sub 'fillIPv4'

	in Util.pm v1.45, add 'fillIPv4' to calls to gethostbyname to 
	work around broken inet_aton and gethostbyname implementations
	in certain BSD implementations

1.39  Wed Nov  2 19:15:31 PDT 2011
	bump rev to incorporate
	improved inet_aton in InetBase v0.04 to overcome broken
	gethostbyname found in NetBSD and OpenBSD

1.38  Fri Oct 28 11:41:22 PDT 2011
	patch for bug 71869, issues with Math::BigInt varients

1.37  Thu Oct 27 12:48:55 PDT 2011
	add detection of early Math::Bigint 0.01 object structures
	circa perl 5.6.1

	remove Calc.pm as part of above

	fix bug 71869 - a failed test routine

1.36  Wed Oct 26 08:52:34 PDT 2011
	fix bug #71925. A a sub-varient of #62521 that showed up only for
	short notation for IPv4. i.e. 127/n, 127.0/n, 127.0.0/n but
	not 127.0.0.0/n

1.35  Tue Oct 25 16:18:38 PDT 2011
	add test for api-version of Math::BigInt to support versions 
	earlier than 1.70, circa Dec 2003. 
	Thanks to Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> for spotting that bug.

1.34  Mon Oct 24 14:38:16 PDT 2011
	use Math::BigInt::Calc for creating BigInt values and fall
	back to NetAddr::IP::Calc if Math::BigInt is not present.
	Thanks to Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> for spotting that bug.

	remove reference to Config{osname} in InetBase.pm v0.03
	(Util 1.43)

1.33  Sat Oct 22 01:47:42 PDT 2011
	In Lite/Util/lib/NetAddr/IP/Lite/Util/InetBase.pm v0.02
	Socket6 prior to version 0.23 does not have AF_INET6 in the
	EXPORT_OK array, modify InetBase.pm v0.2 to work around this.     

	Add support for Math::BigInt objects

1.32  Sat Oct 15 22:05:23 PDT 2011
	bug68723, add capability to parse input of the form
	->new6(12345,1). This should have been there but was
	missing. Thanks to Andrei Benea for spotting this.
	
	In Util v1.41
	add inet_pton, inet_ntop, AF_INET, AF_INET6

	modify inet_n2dx and inet_n2ad to
	recognize the new 128 bit IPv4 format
	::FFFF:FFFF:0:0

	replace isIPv4 with a pure perl version for portablity

	split the following into NetAddr::IP::InetBase v0.01
	to provide better long term support for IPv6
	inet_aton
	inet_ntoa
	ipv6_aton
	ipv6_n2x
	ipv6_n2d
	inet_any2n
	inet_n2dx
	inet_n2ad
	inet_ntop
	inet_pton
	packzeros
	isIPv4
	isNewIPv4
	isAnyIPv4
	AF_INET
	AF_INET6

	updated to UTIL 1.38

1.28  Wed Apr  6 11:31:19 PDT 2011
	Update documentation on the use of "adding constants
	to an IP address".

1.27  Tue Mar 22 15:26:02 PDT 2011
	Update Lite.pm to encompass treatment of /31 and /127 
	point-to-point networks as described in RFC 3021

	NOTE: for /31's and /127's
	this changes the behavior of the following methods:
		first	returns the "network" address
		last	returns the "broadcast" address
		nth	index 0 returns "network" addr instead of undef
		nth	index 1 returns "broadcast" addr instead of undef
		num	returns 2 instead of 0 (zero)

	"old_nth" behavior is unchanged

	Thanks to Todd Caine todd.caine@gmail.com for pointing this out.

1.26  Tue Mar  8 15:18:16 PST 2011
	Updated "sub num" to support usable IP ranges greater than 2**32

	Thanks to Jan Ploski jan@plosquare.com for finding this bug

1.25  Sat Feb 19 10:04:00 PST 2011
	correction to use of Util.pm package lexicals

	thanks to mishikal@yahoo.com for spotting the bug and to
	Mark Martinec mark.martinec+ama...@ijs.si for the solution.

1.24  Fri Dec 17 17:47:47 PST 2010
	Modify subs "new" and "new6" to accomodate
	Cisco mask syntax that uses space instead of "/" for a separator
	This eliminates the need for "new_cis" and "newcis6" which are now
	deprecated.

	Modify t/v4-cnew.t and add t/v6-cnew.t to test the above

1.23  Fri Nov 19 10:48:01 PST 2010
	add :upper and :lower to Lite.pm v1.23
	add comments about rfc5952 requirement for lowercase ipV6 notation
	add test for :lower

1.22  Tue Nov 16 16:28:37 PST 2010
	update new6 to properly classify short ipv4 notation
	i.e. 127/8 with test for ":" rather than match for \d.\d.\d.\d
	
	thanks to Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org for 
	spotting that bug.

	update t/v4-new.t for deprecated array syntax in perl 5.13
	was:	qw(...stuff...)
	is:	(qw(...stuff...))

	thanks to Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> for reporting this

1.21  Thu Oct 28 14:26:19 PDT 2010
	fix bug where new6 improperly assigns the mask value 
	for and ipv4 address in 32 bit space instead of 128 bit space

	Thanks to Mark Martinec and Steve Huff (SHUFF) * shuff@cpan.org
	for spotting and replicating that bug

	added new_cis and new_cis6 to Lite.pm v1.21 to accomodate
	Cisco syntax that has IP and MASK seperated by a space.

	Updated typo in documentation that left out example
	print new6 stuff

1.20  Mon Oct 25 16:22:01 PDT 2010
	Updated _xnew to properly handle ipV6 notation of the form
	xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx, DDD

	Thanks to Dusty Mabe <Dusty.Mabe@tekelec.com> for spotting this bug

1.19  Wed Sep 29 10:32:50 PDT 2010
	Conditionalize import of AF_INET6 in Util.pm
	NetAddr::IP::UtilPolluted

1.18  Wed Sep 22 13:39:08 PDT 2010

1.17  Tue Sep 21 17:50:50 PDT 2010
	Pull Socket6 stuff out of Lite and put into
	NetAddr::IP::Util.pm in its own namespace

1.16  Wed Aug 11 12:45:49 PDT 2010

	or may not be present, from Socket.

1.15  Tue Jul 20 15:32:23 PDT 2010
	Resolve named hosts using gethostbyname, followed by gethostbyname6
	to determine whether to set ipV6 flag

	Thanks to Dusty Mabe <Dusty.Mabe@tekelec.com> for spotting this bug

1.14  Thu Jul  8 18:17:38 PDT 2010
	added support for the sub "new" to resolve host6 names
	if the OPTIONAL perl Socket6 module is available

1.13  Tue Dec  9 16:00:35 PST 2008
	added missing regexp to classify arguments as BCD numbers,
	apparently this has been missing from NetAddr::IP::Lite 
	since the first release. 
	Thanks to Carlos Vicente cvicente@cpan.org for reporting this bug.

	revised UtilPP v1.7 to work around perl 5.8.4
	failures with certain @_ operations of goto &sub...
	see perl bug [ 23429]. Unfortunately, perl-5.8.4 is
	the distribution of choice for many solaris boxes

1.12  Sun Nov 23 19:32:59 PST 2008
	repaired missing sub Zeros

	added minus (-) overloading to allow the subtraction
	of two NetAddr::IP objects to get the difference between
	the object->{addr}'s as a numeric value
	Thanks to Rob Riepel <riepel@networking.Stanford.EDU>
	for the initial code and inspiration for this enhancement

1.11  Sat Nov  1 15:13:48 PST 2008
	add test for characters not allowed by rfc952 before
	the call to gethostbyname in sub new() for those people
	that insist on using deprecated functionality :aton
	and OS's that fail to notice calls to gethostbyname
	with binary arguments

1.10  Wed Oct 22 14:54:12 PDT 2008
	add new no octal method for improperly formatted ipV4 addresses

	In Util.pm v1.22, eliminated dependence on PL_sawampersand
	thanks to Mark Martinec <Mark.Martinec@ijs.si>
	for spotting this and submitting a patch.

	In Util.pm v1.22, force -noxs mode for Win32

	In Util.pm v1.22, use autoconf to configure 'C' build

1.09  Thu Oct 16 19:35:33 PDT 2008
	again... clear build bug for Win32 in Util.pm v 1.21

1.08  Sat Sep 27 12:27:28 PDT 2008
    in Util v0.19
	updated test for ENDIANess in siteconf

	add test in inet_aton to detect overange IP dot quad values
	missed by some broken Socket implementations
	i.e. 256.1.1.1

1.07  Tue Sep  2 19:09:57 PDT 2008
	in the off chance that NetAddr::IP::Lite objects are created
	and the caller later loads NetAddr::IP and expects to use
	those objects, let the AUTOLOAD routine find and redirect
	NetAddr::IP::Lite method and subroutine calls to NetAddr::IP.

	updated t/v4-wnew.t so that non-existent
	domains are "really" not there

1.06  Sat Jun  7 12:57:18 PDT 2008
	add method "new_from_aton" and related documentation

	comparisons of the form <, >, <=, >=
		10.0.0.0/24 {operator} 10.0.0.0/16
	return now return the comparison of the cidr value
	when the address portion is equal.
NOTE:	this comparison returns the comparison of the NUMERIC
	value of the CIDR. This produces the counter intuitive result
	that /24 > /16. There is logic to this, really! For proper
	operation of commands like "Compact" and "Coalesce", lists of
	netaddr objects must sort in ascending order. However, this
	conflicts with the requirement for larger netblocks to sort
	FIRST so as to include smaller ones. This logic extends to
	any requirement for a sort of netaddr objects. It should be
	further noted that the mixing of netaddr objects with varying
	IP addresses and CIDR allocations can lead to unexpected
	results since the comparisons done first on the IP portion
	and then on the CIDR portion. The documentation has been
	updated appropriately.
	Thanks to Peter DeVries for spotting this discrepancy
