.B psadwatchd [options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B psadwatchd
checks on an interval of every five seconds to make sure that kmsgsd

email address listed in the EMAIL_ADDRESSES variable (see
/etc/psad/psad.conf) that the daemon has been restarted.

located at /etc/psad/psad.conf, but a different path can be specified
on the command line.
